This project develops a robust Machine Learning pipeline to forecast $PM_{2.5}$ concentration levels in Miami-Dade County, focusing on the unique interplay between urban emissions and coastal meteorology. Unlike landlocked cities, Miami’s air quality is governed by tropical factors, specifically the Atlantic Sea Breeze and high humidity.
